## Info
This application is intended to help developers experiment with the APIs at a high level without needing to know how to make API requests.

It also supports making authenticated calls using Bungie's Official [[User Authentication|Authentication]].

This application was developed in good faith and neither your API Key or Bungie.net session are tracked in any way. Use at your own risk.
