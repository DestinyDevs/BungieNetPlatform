## Info
As you run into items that need to be classified for Milestone purposes in ways that we cannot infer via Babel or Bonbobo-sourced data, add a new classification here and use a string constant to represent it in the local item config file. NOTE: This is not all of the item types available, and some of these are holdovers from Destiny 1 that may or may not still exist.
