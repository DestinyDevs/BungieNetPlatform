## Info
Represents whatever information we can return about an explicit phase in an activity.In the future, I hope we'll have more than just &quot;guh, you done gone and did something,&quot;but for the forseeable future that's all we've got.  I'm making it more than just a list ofbooleans out of that overly-optimistic hope.

## Schema

## Properties
Name | Type | Description
